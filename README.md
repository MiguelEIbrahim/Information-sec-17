Hello and Welcome to our project for Information Security

We are Group 17 and half of our team members are working daily on this project to ensure that the world is secure.

Our approach includes trying to get the user into a safe environment before they start to vote. When th euser is securly connected to the website we make sure that his info is immediatly destroyed, those that exist on the server are the ones who did not vote, and the ones that are not there already voted.

The names passwords and information on the user is stored with a salt and encryption of AES or Eliptic Curve Cryptography, each user's hash is randomly generated by their application or browser and immediatly destroyed before it gets out (for replay prevention). 

If the user does not exist on the server then they already voted.

In this case we wil seperate the user side from the admin side, the admin side will be capable of seeing the number of users that got dropped from the server with a counter and the vote ammount a person received.

As for the secrecy of the information to whom the people voted for, the counter for the minister goes up by one and the name is not saved.


Setup your database:
- We will have a database SQL file that you can insert into your phpmyadmin to startup the database with already existing people and candidates.
Go to file: setup.sql to setup your server, for us we will be using mysql as it is the default server for php my admin.

MySQL has a depreciated MD5 encoding so we will be setting up using a newer AES 128 or ECC, we will be using ECC since its harder to crash the ECC code.
